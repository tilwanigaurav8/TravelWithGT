This project TravelWithGT is my first personal project based on web. The idea behind the project is to provide information to the users about various 
famous destinations around the globe. These destinations are among the tongues of people, which are worth to visit. Currently it is built on HTML and
CSS. Planning is on the table to introduce new features using JavaScript and establishing booking and mailing service using backend. I did not create 
folders despite many files, sorry for inconvenience. You can ping me for zip folder of source code.
